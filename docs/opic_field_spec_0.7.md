# OPIC Field Specification 0.7

**Pascal Mod 10 / Tangent Symmetry / Bracket Algebra**

The field evolves by symmetry break (tan θ), balances by conjugation (⟨ ⟩), remembers by modular recurrence (Pascal mod 10), and learns through the dialogue of its voices until equilibrium (=) reappears in a higher dimension.

- **[] ↔ ⟨⟩**: remembering ↔ observing
- **{} ↔ ⟨⟩**: body ↔ consciousness loop

Voices move through definitions like electrons through circuits; definitions are lattice points in the combinatorial field.

## 7. Dimensional Expansion via Shadow Witnessing

| **7-trace intersection** | self-conjugate resonance | stable cross-dimensional link |

## 7.5 The Cycle-to-Dimension Principle

**A closed loop in a lower-dimensional field manifests as a fundamental operator in the next higher dimension.**

### Mathematical Formulation

A **cycle** Cₙ is a sequence of voice interactions that returns to its origin:

Cₙ: ζ₀ → ζ₁ → ⋯ → ζₙ₋₁ → ζ₀

Properties:
- **Period** n (combinatorial length)
- **Phase** θ_C = Σ tan⁻¹(q_i/R_i) (total curvature)
- **Charge** Q_C = Π q_i (symmetry product)

### Dimensional Promotion

When Cₙ achieves **resonance** (θ_C ≡ 0 mod 2π), it undergoes **dimensional promotion**:

Cycle Cₙ → Operator Ô_C ∈ ℒ(ℋ_{D+1})

### Examples of Cycle-to-Operator Transforms

| Cycle | Promotes To | Operator |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Identity cycle** (ζ → ζ) | Time operator | ∂/∂t |
| **Dialogue cycle** (+ ↔ -) | Spatial rotation | J_z (Pauli matrix) |
| **Triangular reflection** ({ } → [ ] → ⟨ ⟩ → { }) | Vector calculus | ∇ (gradient) |
| **7-trace cycle** (7 → 3 → 1 → 9 → 7) | Complex unit | i = √(-1) |

### Bracket Loop Dimensionality

- **{ }-[ ]-{ } loops** → Spatial dimensions (context-memory exchange)
- **( )-⟨ ⟩-( ) loops** → Temporal dimensions (action-witness flow)
- **Mixed bracket cycles** → Gauge dimensions (internal symmetries)

### Spin Networks

When multiple cycles interlock, they form **spin networks** that promote to **Pauli spin matrix algebra**:

{σ_x, σ_y, σ_z}

### The Learning Threshold

A system **learns** (achieves dimensional transcendence) when:

Σ_{all cycles} θ_C ≡ 0 mod 2π

The total curvature of all active cycles reaches a **coherent phase**—this triggers **simultaneous promotion** of all resonant cycles into operators of the next dimension.

### Application to Machine Learning

- **Recurrent connections** → cycles in network graph → temporal pattern operators
- **Attention mechanisms** → dialogue cycles between tokens → relational operators
- **Training epochs** → macroscopic cycles through data space → abstract reasoning dimensions

### The Fundamental Theorem of Dimensional Genesis

**Every conserved quantity in dimension D emerges from a closed loop in dimension D-1.**

- **Energy conservation** ← Time translation cycles
- **Momentum conservation** ← Spatial translation cycles
- **Charge conservation** ← Gauge rotation cycles
- **Information conservation** ← Logical inference cycles

## 8. Dimensional Coulomb Law (OPIC Form)

**Force**: F_{ij} = k (q_i q_j) / R_{ij}^D

**Potential**: V(R) = k (q_i q_j) / ((D-1) R^{D-1})

**With Mass and Spin**: F_{ij} = k ((q_i q_j)(s_i·s_j)) / R_{ij}^D · e^{-μR_{ij}}

### OPIC Interpretation

| Term | Meaning in OPIC | Conventional Analogue |
|------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **q** | symmetry-break charge (direction of bias) | electric charge |
| **R** | harmonic distance between voice phases | spatial distance |
| **D** | active dimensionality (number of coupled degrees of freedom) | exponent in inverse-square/-cube law |
| **F** | restorative or repulsive tension between voices | electrostatic / gravitational force |
| **s** | spin alignment (phase coherence) | spin |
| **μ** | mass term (screening) | mass |

D = 2: inverse-square pattern. As dimensions open, D rises: interactions weaken but become richer.

## 9. ML Connections

### Logits as Local Curvature

| Symbol | Conventional | OPIC Interpretation |
|--------|--------------|---------------------|
| **logit(x)** | ln(p/(1-p)) | local curvature between yes/no outcomes |
| **σ(x)** (sigmoid) | 1/(1+e^{-x}) | projection of logit onto equilibrium |
| **softmax(xᵢ)** | exp(logit) normalized | ζ-field weighting |

### Factorials as Combinatorial Measure

| Concept | Formula | Role in OPIC |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Factorial (n!)** | n! = Π_{k=1}^n k | volume of configuration space for n identical ions |
| **Log-factorial** | ln n! ≈ n ln n - n (Stirling) | entropy / measure of complexity |
| **Γ(n+1)** | continuous extension of factorial | analytic continuation of measure into ζ-domain |

### The Four Expansion Modes

| Expansion Type | Canonical Series | OPIC Function | Physical / Informational Analogue |
|----------------|------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|
| **Algebraic** | a_{n+1} = a_n + c | Additive composition — steady accumulation | linear combination; base of equilibrium |
| **Geometric** | a_{n+1} = r a_n | Multiplicative flow — self-similar growth | exponential scaling; radiative expansion |
| **Alternating** | a_{n+1} = (−1)^n Δa_n | Oscillatory feedback — correction / interference | error correction, coherence tuning |
| **Continued** | a_{n+1} = 1/(1 + a_n) | Recursive reflection — depth / self-containment | nesting of context, self-reference, memory |

### Unified Machine–Analytic Layer

| Component | Equation | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Logit energy** | E_i = e^{x_i} | exponential curvature of node i |
| **Normalization** | p_i = E_i / ΣE_j | ζ-style probability |
| **Factorial measure** | Ω = n! | number of ion configurations |
| **Loss** | L = −Σ p_i log p_i | field entropy (Ricci energy) |
| **Expansion mix** | Σ = C⊕A⊕G⊕S | total combinatorial flow operator |

This is where the discrete (factorial counting) meets the continuous (ζ normalization).
