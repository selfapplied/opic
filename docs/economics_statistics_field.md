# Economics & Statistics: Field Dynamics of Markets and Data

## Core Insight

**Economics & Statistics = field dynamics!**

Markets, prices, distributions, and probabilities all follow field equations. Economics and statistics are field dynamics at different scales.

## The Mapping

```
Economics → Market Field Dynamics → Price → Equilibrium
Statistics → Statistical Field Dynamics → Distribution → Probability
```

### 1. **Supply and Demand → Field Supply and Demand**

- **Supply** = field source
- **Demand** = field sink
- **Price** = field potential
- **Market equilibrium** = field equilibrium
- Scale: Market (D≈2.5)

### 2. **Market Dynamics → Field Dynamics**

- Market evolution = field evolution
- Price adjustment = field adjustment
- Market clearing = field clearing

### 3. **Probability → Field Probability**

- **Probability** = field probability
- **Probability distribution** = field distribution
- **Normal distribution** = field normal distribution
- Scale: Statistical (D≈2.5)

### 4. **Statistics → Field Statistics**

- **Mean** = field center
- **Variance** = field spread
- **Correlation** = field correlation
- **Covariance** = field covariance

## Implementation

### Market Equilibrium

```python
Supply: Q = 2.0P
Demand: Q = 100 - 1.0P
Equilibrium: supply = demand
Equilibrium price: 33.33
Equilibrium quantity: 66.67
```

### Normal Distribution

```python
PDF: f(x) = (1/√(2πσ²)) e^(-(x-μ)²/(2σ²))

Mean: 0.0, Variance: 1.0
PDF at x=1.0: 0.2420
```

### Correlation

```python
r = cov(X,Y) / (σ_X σ_Y)

X: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Y: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
Correlation: 1.000 (perfect positive)
```

## Applications

### 1. **Market Analysis**

- Supply/demand curves = field source/sink curves
- Price = field potential
- Equilibrium = field equilibrium
- Predicts market behavior

### 2. **Statistical Analysis**

- Distributions = field distributions
- Mean = field center
- Variance = field spread
- Correlation = field correlation

### 3. **Economic Modeling**

- Market dynamics = field dynamics
- Price adjustment = field adjustment
- Market evolution = field evolution

## Examples

### Example 1: Market Equilibrium

**Question**: "How do supply and demand determine price?"

**Answer**:
- Supply = field source, Demand = field sink
- Market equilibrium = field equilibrium
- Price = field potential
- When supply = demand, market reaches equilibrium

### Example 2: Probability

**Question**: "What is probability?"

**Answer**:
- Probability = field probability
- Probability distributions = field distributions
- Normal distribution = field normal distribution
- Follows field probability equations

### Example 3: Correlation

**Question**: "What is correlation?"

**Answer**:
- Correlation = field correlation
- Measures field relationships between variables
- r = cov(X,Y) / (σ_X σ_Y)
- Reveals field connections

## Connection to Field Spec 0.7

This implementation uses:

- **Field Potential** (§9): `V(R) = k(q₁q₂)/((D-1)R^{D-1})`
- **Field Equilibrium** (§9): Equilibrium = field equilibrium
- **Field Evolution** (§9): Market dynamics = field evolution
- **Field Distribution** (§9): Probability distributions = field distributions

## Key Insight

**Economics & Statistics = field dynamics!**

- Supply = field source, Demand = field sink
- Price = field potential, Market equilibrium = field equilibrium
- Probability = field probability, Distributions = field distributions
- Mean = field center, Variance = field spread
- Correlation = field correlation (measures field relationships)

All economics and statistics follow field equations!

## Conclusion

Economics and statistics follow field equations. By mapping economics and statistics to field equations, we:

1. **Understand** markets as field markets
2. **Explain** prices as field potentials
3. **Connect** distributions to field distributions
4. **Relate** correlation to field correlation

Economics & Statistics = field dynamics!

This shows that even abstract concepts like markets and probabilities follow the same fundamental field equations - same equations, different scales!
