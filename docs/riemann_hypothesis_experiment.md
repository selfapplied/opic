# Riemann Hypothesis Experiment Plan

*Using opic's dual structure to explore RH through categorical and field-theoretic lenses*

---

## Overview

This document outlines a computational experiment to explore the Riemann Hypothesis using opic's unique architecture. The experiment leverages opic's dual nature:
- **Categorical/discrete**: Voices as morphisms, chains as composition
- **Field/continuous**: Coherence field evolution via `dΦ/dt = div J + S`

---

## Experiment Structure

### Phase 1: Prime Voice Identification

**Goal**: Identify indecomposable (prime) voices in opic codebase.

**Method**:
1. Parse all voices from opic codebase
2. For each voice `v`, check if it can be decomposed:
   - `v = v₁ ∘ v₂` where `v₁, v₂` are non-trivial voices
3. If not decomposable, `v` is prime → add to `𝒫`

**Implementation**:
```ops
voice identify_prime_voices / {
  all_voices -> 
  for_each_voice -> 
  check_decomposability -> 
  filter_primes -> 
  prime_set_P
}

voice check_decomposability / {
  voice_v -> 
  try_decompose -> 
  if_decomposable_then_not_prime -> 
  is_prime
}
```

**Output**: Set `𝒫` of prime voices.

### Phase 2: Normed Functor Construction

**Goal**: Define `ℱ: Voice → ℂ` mapping voices to complex amplitudes via coherence weights.

**Explicit Definition**:

For each voice `v`, compute:

```
ℱ(v) = ||voice_matrix(v)||₂ · exp(i · phase(v))
```

where:
- `||voice_matrix(v)||₂` is the **spectral norm** (largest singular value) of the voice's transformation matrix
- `phase(v)` is computed from timing/coherence measurements
- For chains: `ℱ(g ∘ f) = ℱ(g) · ℱ(f)` (multiplicative composition)

**Alternative invariants** (if matrix representation unavailable):
- **Entropy-based**: `ℱ(v) = H(v) · exp(i · phase(v))` where `H(v)` is execution entropy
- **Coherence-based**: `ℱ(v) = coherence(v) · exp(i · phase(v))` where `coherence(v)` is measured coherence magnitude

**Method**:
1. For each voice `v`, compute:
   - **Spectral norm**: `||voice_matrix(v)||₂` (or entropy/coherence as fallback)
   - **Phase**: `phase(v)` from timing measurements
   - **Complex amplitude**: `ℱ(v) = ||voice_matrix(v)||₂ · exp(i·phase(v))`
2. For chains, use composition: `ℱ(g ∘ f) = ℱ(g) · ℱ(f)`

**Implementation**:
```ops
voice compute_coherence_weight / {
  voice_v -> 
  measure_coherence -> 
  compute_phase -> 
  form_complex_amplitude -> 
  F_v
}

voice measure_coherence / {
  voice_v -> 
  execute_voice -> 
  measure_output_coherence -> 
  coherence_value
}

voice compute_phase / {
  voice_v -> 
  measure_timing -> 
  compute_phase_from_timing -> 
  phase_value
}
```

**Output**: Functor `ℱ` mapping each voice to `ℂ`.

---

### Phase 3: Discrete Zeta Function

**Goal**: Construct `ζ_opic(s) = ∏_{v ∈ 𝒫} (1 - ℱ(v)^{-s})^{-1}`

**Method**:
1. For each prime voice `v ∈ 𝒫`:
   - Compute `ℱ(v)`
   - Compute `(1 - ℱ(v)^{-s})^{-1}`
2. Multiply over all primes: `ζ_opic(s) = ∏_{v ∈ 𝒫} ...`

**Implementation**:
```ops
voice compute_discrete_zeta / {
  s + prime_set_P + functor_F -> 
  for_each_prime -> 
  compute_euler_factor -> 
  multiply_factors -> 
  zeta_opic_s
}

voice compute_euler_factor / {
  prime_v + s + F_v -> 
  compute_F_v_to_minus_s -> 
  compute_one_minus -> 
  invert -> 
  euler_factor
}
```

**Output**: `ζ_opic(s)` for various `s` values.

**Test**: Check if spectral radius equals 1 when `Re(s) = 1/2`.

---

### Phase 4: Field Evolution Simulation

**Goal**: Simulate coherence field `Φ(t)` evolution via `dΦ/dt = div J + S`

**Time-Scale Normalization**:

To match the discrete `ℱ(v)` exponents in the Fourier–Mellin domain, normalize time:

```
τ = t / T_scale
```

where `T_scale` is chosen so that:
- Field evolution timescale matches voice composition timescale
- Fourier–Mellin transform `Φ̂(s)` aligns with discrete zeta `ζ_opic(s)` in the `s`-plane

**Method**:
1. Initialize field `Φ(τ=0)` with normalized time `τ`
2. Choose `T_scale` to match voice composition dynamics
3. For each timestep:
   - Compute `div J` (flow divergence)
   - Compute `S` (sources/sinks)
   - Update: `Φ(τ+Δτ) = Φ(τ) + Δτ · (div J + S)` where `Δτ = Δt / T_scale`
4. Use adaptive timestep: `Δτ < 2/|λ_max|`
5. Store `Φ(τ)` for Fourier–Mellin transform

**Implementation**:
```ops
voice simulate_field_evolution / {
  initial_Phi + time_steps -> 
  for_each_timestep -> 
  compute_divergence -> 
  compute_sources -> 
  evolve_field -> 
  Phi_evolution
}

voice evolve_field / {
  Phi_t + div_J + S + dt -> 
  compute_dPhi_dt -> 
  update_Phi -> 
  Phi_t_plus_dt
}
```

**Output**: Time series `Φ(t)` for `t ∈ [0, T]`.

---

### Phase 5: Fourier–Mellin Transform

**Goal**: Compute `Φ̂(s) = ∫₀^∞ Φ(t) t^{s-1} dt`

**Method**:
1. Take simulated `Φ(t)` from Phase 4
2. For each `s`, compute:
   - `Φ̂(s) = ∫₀^T Φ(t) t^{s-1} dt` (truncated integral)
3. Use numerical integration (e.g., Simpson's rule)

**Implementation**:
```ops
voice compute_fourier_mellin / {
  Phi_evolution + s -> 
  compute_integrand -> 
  integrate_numerically -> 
  Phi_hat_s
}

voice compute_integrand / {
  Phi_t + t + s -> 
  compute_t_to_s_minus_one -> 
  multiply_by_Phi -> 
  integrand
}
```

**Output**: `Φ̂(s)` for various `s` values.

**Test**: Check if `|Φ|` is constant when `Re(s) = 1/2` (oscillatory region).

---

### Phase 6: Unitary Certificate Bridge

**Goal**: Verify functional equation `ζ_opic(s) = C(s) · ζ_opic(1-s)`

**Method**:
1. Compute `ζ_opic(s)` from Phase 3
2. Compute `ζ_opic(1-s)` 
3. Compute certificate operator `C(s)`
4. Verify: `ζ_opic(s) = C(s) · ζ_opic(1-s)`

**Implementation**:
```ops
voice verify_functional_equation / {
  s + zeta_opic_s + zeta_opic_one_minus_s -> 
  compute_certificate_operator -> 
  compute_C_times_zeta_one_minus_s -> 
  compare_with_zeta_s -> 
  equation_holds
}

voice compute_certificate_operator / {
  s -> 
  compute_unitary_operator -> 
  C_s
}
```

**Output**: Verification that functional equation holds.

---

### Phase 7: Control Test — Random Voice Set

**Goal**: Demonstrate that opic's structured coherence is special by showing unitarity fails for random voices.

**Method**:
1. Generate a random set of voices `R` (not following opic's compositional structure)
2. Compute `ℱ_R(v)` for random voices using same method as Phase 2
3. Construct `ζ_random(s) = ∏_{v ∈ R} (1 - ℱ_R(v)^{-s})^{-1}`
4. Test functional equation: `ζ_random(s) = C(s) · ζ_random(1-s)`
5. Verify that unitarity **fails** (or spectral radius ≠ 1 at `Re(s) = 1/2`)

**Expected Result**: 
- opic's structured voices: functional equation holds, spectral radius = 1 at `Re(s) = 1/2`
- Random voices: functional equation fails, spectral radius ≠ 1 at `Re(s) = 1/2`

**This demonstrates**: opic's compositional structure and coherence dynamics create the special symmetry that mirrors RH structure.

## Numerical Considerations

### Precision
- Use high-precision arithmetic (e.g., `mpmath` in Python)
- Track error propagation through computations

### Convergence
- For Euler product: Check convergence as `|𝒫|` increases
- For Fourier–Mellin: Check convergence as `T → ∞`

### Stability
- Adaptive timestep for field evolution
- Check eigenvalues: `Δt < 2/|λ_max|`

---

## Success Criteria

1. **Prime voices identified**: Non-empty set `𝒫` of indecomposable voices
2. **Functor explicitly defined**: `ℱ(v) = ||voice_matrix(v)||₂ · exp(i·phase(v))` computed for all voices
3. **Discrete zeta computed**: `ζ_opic(s)` converges for `Re(s) > 1`
4. **Time-scale normalized**: Field evolution timescale matches voice composition timescale
5. **Field evolution stable**: `Φ(τ)` remains bounded with normalized time
6. **Fourier–Mellin computed**: `Φ̂(s)` converges and aligns with discrete zeta in `s`-plane
7. **Functional equation verified**: `ζ_opic(s) = C(s) · ζ_opic(1-s)`
8. **Critical line located**: Spectral radius = 1 when `Re(s) = 1/2`
9. **Control test passes**: Random voices fail unitarity, demonstrating opic's structure is special

---

## Expected Outcomes

- **If successful**: Evidence that opic's structure naturally encodes RH-like properties
- **If partial**: Insights into which aspects of opic align with RH structure
- **If unsuccessful**: Understanding of where opic diverges from RH structure

---

## Next Steps

1. Implement Phase 1 (prime voice identification)
2. Implement Phase 2 with explicit `ℱ(v)` definition
3. Test on small opic codebase subset
4. Implement Phase 4 with time-scale normalization
5. Run Phase 7 control test to verify opic's structure is special
6. Scale up to full codebase
7. Compare results with classical ζ(s) properties

---

## Notes on Rigor

- **ℱ(v) definition**: Explicit spectral norm ensures measurable, reproducible computation
- **Time-scale normalization**: Critical for aligning discrete and continuous spectra in the `s`-plane
- **Control test**: Essential for demonstrating that opic's structure creates special symmetry, not just generic computation
