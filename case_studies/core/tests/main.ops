TESTS CASE STUDY
======================================================================

TEST HARNESS OVERVIEW
=====================

OPIC treats each test as a field specimen:
- Scoring voices map outputs to φₖ curvature and coherence
- Self-tests demonstrate that voices can validate themselves
- Executor flow tests follow a chain from input -> parse -> execute -> witness

FIELD-SCORE EXAMPLE
-------------------
  test_result ->
    test.compute_field ->
    test.measure_curvature ->
    test.compute_coherence ->
    score (1 - |φₖ_actual - φₖ_expected| / (avg + 1))

This shows how reasoning-free tests still rely on the same energy minimization logic.

SELF-TEST LOOP
--------------
Each test file is executable and asserts:
- Structural integrity (definitions expand correctly)
- Voice reachability (implicit attention can find them)
- Narrative proof strings that document what was validated

EXECUTOR FLOW TRACE
-------------------
  input -> opic.parse -> opic.load -> opic.execute_chain -> result

The executor flow test logs each phase, showing the implicit matcher dispatching
to voices such as `opic.match_voice_body_pattern` and `opic.execute_chain`.

TAKEAWAYS
---------
- Tests are first-class voices, not external artifacts
- Scoring relies on the same φₖ / charge-mass field model as the rest of OPIC
- Include-free, attention-driven loading keeps the suite self-healing
