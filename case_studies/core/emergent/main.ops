EMERGENT CASE STUDY
======================================================================

ACTOR-COUPLED MODELING
======================

An actor-coupled model is the primordial OPIC abstraction:
  • actors with morphisms F_A : S_t → S_{t+1}
  • causal graphs capturing state → state transitions
  • control parameters steering behavior
  • metric functionals observing outcomes
  • iteration: S_{t+1} = F_A(S_t; r)
  • regime reveal: fixed / periodic / chaotic / unknown
  • critical geometry via α–δ scaling
  • universality embedding through zeta traces / field curvature
  • version evolution (git-like DAG) as witness history

REGIME REVEAL
-------------
observable_sequence ->
  variance_of_sequence ->
  autocorrelation_of_sequence ->
  period_of_sequence ->
  lyapunov_of_sequence ->
  regime_from_properties ->
  regime

This isn’t classification. The sequence *already is* its regime;
we simply unfold what the geometry is telling us.

CAUSAL GRAPH LOOP
-----------------
state_t + actor + state_{t+1} ->
  causal_graph.add_edge ->
  updated_graph

Tracking the entire causal chain lets OPIC derive witnesses for
emergent behavior, not just snapshots.

VERSION EVOLUTION
-----------------
git.commit -> git.push -> git.merge ⇒ actor_coupled_model.version_evolve

Every evolution is a morphism. Git history becomes a discrete trace
of actor interactions, suitable for replay or field analysis.

TAKEAWAYS
---------
  • Emergence = actor iteration under field metrics, not accidents.
  • Regimes are geometric identities discovered via α–δ + Lyapunov curvature.
  • Version DAGs are part of the physics: they store causal witnesses.
