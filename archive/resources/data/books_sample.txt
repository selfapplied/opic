The Art of War by Sun Tzu

War is a matter of vital importance to the state. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.

The art of war is governed by five constant factors. These are: the Moral Law, Heaven, Earth, the Commander, and Method and Discipline.

The Moral Law causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives.

Heaven signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons.

Earth comprises distances, great and small; danger and security; open ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death.

The Commander stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, courage, and strictness.

Method and Discipline are to be understood as the marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions, the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the control of military expenditure.

These five heads should be familiar to every general. He who knows them will be victorious; he who knows them not will fail.

The Prince by Niccolò Machiavelli

It is better to be feared than loved, if you cannot be both. For men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails.

A prince should show himself a lover of merit, give preferment to the able, and honor those who excel in every art. He should encourage his citizens to practice their callings peaceably, both in commerce and agriculture, and in every other following, so that the one should not be deterred from improving his possessions for fear they should be taken away from him, and another from opening up trade for fear of taxes.

The prince who has more to fear from the people than from foreigners ought to build fortresses, but he who has more to fear from foreigners than from the people ought to leave them alone.

The Republic by Plato

Justice is giving each man his due. The just man is the one who does his own work and does not meddle with what is not his own.

The state is the individual writ large. As the individual has three parts—reason, spirit, and appetite—so the state has three classes—rulers, auxiliaries, and producers.

The philosopher-king is the ideal ruler, one who has knowledge of the Good and uses it to govern justly.

Education is the process of turning the soul toward the light, away from the shadows of the cave.

The unexamined life is not worth living. Philosophy begins in wonder.
