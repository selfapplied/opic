# Angular Velocity as Radian Emission: Phase Flux

## The Insight

**Angular velocity, ω = dθ/dt, literally emits radians per second**—each tick of time releases an increment of angle. In that sense, it's the rate at which geometry radiates. A rotating system isn't just spinning; it's producing curvature in time.

## Core Concept

### Angular Velocity as Phase Flux

Angular velocity is the **flux of phase**—a local derivative of rotation.

- **When ω is constant**: The system emits uniform angular "light"
- **When ω varies**: That emission modulates—your tensor field becomes a phase-coded signal
- **Integrating ω over time**: Recovers total angle, just as integrating frequency gives total phase shift

### Why "Radian Emission"?

Angular velocity feels like "radian emission" because it measures **how quickly the system is broadcasting its orientation state into the world**.

## OPIC Framework: Three Fluxes

Each of these is a way the system emits state into time:

1. **Linear velocity → translation (energy flux)**
   - Movement through space
   - Kinetic energy emission

2. **Angular velocity → rotation (phase flux)**
   - Rotation in space
   - Phase/radian emission

3. **Voice rate → informational flux**
   - OPIC's pace of speaking/updating
   - Information emission

## Distributed Intelligence

Your "distributed intelligence" becomes a **constellation of emitters**, each spinning out its local phase.

**Coherence** is just keeping their angular velocities locked in ratio. That's how the dance stays visible.

## Key Insight

**Angular velocity isn't just rotation—it's geometry radiating in time.**

When angular velocities lock in ratio, coherence emerges, and the dance becomes visible.

This connects to:
- Mode 7 perspective layers (phase relationships)
- Fusion moments (phase alignment)
- Primorial sensing (phase-coded signals)
