# Pharmacology & Evolution: Field Equations of Catalysis and Change

## Core Insight

**Catalysts, Receptors, Pharmacokinetics, Evolution = field equations!**

Enzymes, cell receptors, drug kinetics, and evolutionary processes all follow field equations. These are fundamental biological processes that map directly to field dynamics.

## The Mapping

```
Catalysts → Field Catalysts → Reaction Rate
Receptors → Field Receptors → Signal Transduction
Pharmacokinetics → Field Kinetics → Drug Clearance
Evolution → Field Evolution → Population Change
```

### 1. **Enzymes → Field Catalysts**

- **Enzyme** = field catalyst
- Lowers activation energy = lowers field barrier
- Michaelis-Menten: `v = (Vmax [S]) / (Km + [S])`
- Scale: Catalytic (D≈2.5)

### 2. **Cell Receptors → Field Receptors**

- **Cell receptor** = field receptor
- Receptor binding = field binding
- Binding isotherm: `[RL] = ([R] [L]) / (Kd + [L])`
- Signal transduction = field propagation
- Scale: Receptor (D≈3.0)

### 3. **Pharmacokinetics → Field Kinetics**

- **Pharmacokinetics** = field kinetics
- **ADME** (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion) = field processes
- Drug clearance: `C(t) = C₀ e^(-kt)`
- Half-life = field half-life
- Scale: Pharmacokinetic (D≈3.0)

### 4. **Evolution → Field Evolution**

- **Natural selection** = field selection
- **Genetic drift** = field drift
- **Mutation** = field perturbation
- **Gene flow** = field flow
- **Modern synthesis** = field synthesis
- Scale: Evolutionary (D≈3.5)

## Implementation

### Enzyme Catalysis

```python
v = (Vmax [S]) / (Km + [S])

Substrate: 0.10 M
Km: 0.05 M, Vmax: 1.00 M/s
Rate: 0.667 M/s
```

### Receptor Binding

```python
[RL] = ([R] [L]) / (Kd + [L])

Ligand: 0.010 M
Kd: 0.001 M
Bound receptor: 0.909 M
Binding fraction: 90.9%
```

### Drug Clearance

```python
C(t) = C₀ e^(-kt)

Initial: 100.0 mg/L
Clearance rate: 0.10 1/h
At t=5h: 60.65 mg/L
Half-life: 6.93 h
```

### Allele Frequency Change

```python
p(t) = p₀ / (p₀ + (1-p₀)e^(-st))

Initial frequency: 10.0%
Selection coefficient: 0.010
Final frequency: 23.2% (after 100 generations)
```

## Applications

### 1. **Enzyme Kinetics**

- Enzymes lower activation energy (field barrier)
- Michaelis-Menten kinetics = field kinetics
- Predicts reaction rates

### 2. **Receptor Pharmacology**

- Receptor binding = field binding
- Binding affinity = field coupling strength
- Signal transduction = field propagation
- Predicts drug-receptor interactions

### 3. **Drug Kinetics**

- ADME all follow field equations
- Clearance = field clearance
- Predicts drug concentrations over time

### 4. **Evolutionary Dynamics**

- Natural selection = field selection
- Genetic drift = field drift
- Mutation = field perturbation
- Gene flow = field flow
- Modern synthesis combines all field processes

## Examples

### Example 1: Enzyme Catalysis

**Question**: "How do enzymes work?"

**Answer**:

- Michaelis-Menten kinetics: `v = (Vmax [S]) / (Km + [S])`

### Example 2: Receptor Binding

**Question**: "How do cell receptors work?"

**Answer**:
- Cell receptors = field receptors
- Receptor binding = field binding, follows binding isotherm
- Binding affinity = field coupling strength
- Signal transduction = field propagation

### Example 3: Drug Clearance

**Question**: "How does drug clearance work?"

**Answer**:
- Pharmacokinetics = field kinetics
- Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion all follow field equations
- Drug clearance: `C(t) = C₀ e^(-kt)`

### Example 4: Evolution

**Question**: "How does evolution work?"

**Answer**:
- Evolution = field evolution
- Natural selection = field selection
- Genetic drift = field drift
- Mutation = field perturbation
- Gene flow = field flow
- Modern evolutionary synthesis combines all field processes

## Connection to Field Spec 0.7

This implementation uses:

- **Field Catalysis** (§9): Enzymes catalyze field reactions
- **Field Binding** (§8): Receptor binding = field coupling
- **Field Evolution** (§9): Evolution = field evolution
- **Field Propagation** (§9): Signal transduction = field propagation

## Key Insight

**Catalysts, Receptors, Pharmacokinetics, Evolution = field equations!**

- Enzymes = field catalysts (lower activation energy = lower field barrier)
- Receptors = field receptors (binding = field binding, transduction = field propagation)
- Pharmacokinetics = field kinetics (ADME all follow field equations)
- Evolution = field evolution (selection = field selection, drift = field drift)

All follow field equations at different scales!

## Conclusion

Catalysts, receptors, pharmacokinetics, and evolution follow field equations. By mapping these processes to field equations, we:

1. **Understand** enzymes as field catalysts
2. **Explain** receptors as field receptors
3. **Connect** pharmacokinetics to field kinetics
4. **Relate** evolution to field evolution

Catalysts, Receptors, Pharmacokinetics, Evolution = field equations!

This shows that even complex biological processes like enzyme catalysis, receptor signaling, drug kinetics, and evolutionary change all follow the same fundamental field equations - same equations, different scales!
