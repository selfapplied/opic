# Quantum Vacuum: Field Equations of Empty Space

## Core Insight

**Quantum vacuum = field vacuum!**

Vacuum fluctuations, zero-point energy, and Planck constants all follow field equations. The vacuum of space is not empty - it's a field with zero-point energy and fluctuations.

## The Mapping

```
Vacuum State → Field Vacuum → Zero-Point Energy → Field Properties
```

### 1. **Zero-Point Energy → Field Zero-Point**

- **Zero-point energy** = field zero-point energy
- Equation: `E₀ = (1/2)ħω`
- Even in vacuum, fields have minimum energy

### 2. **Vacuum Fluctuations → Field Fluctuations**

- **Vacuum fluctuations** = field fluctuations
- Equation: `ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2`
- Energy-time uncertainty creates fluctuations

### 3. **Planck Constants → Field Constants**

- **Planck length** = fundamental field length scale
- **Planck time** = fundamental field time scale
- **Planck mass** = fundamental field mass scale
- **Planck energy** = fundamental field energy scale

## Implementation

### Planck Scales

```python
Planck Length: l_P = √(ħG/c³) ≈ 1.6×10⁻³⁵ m
Planck Time: t_P = l_P/c ≈ 5.4×10⁻⁴⁴ s
Planck Mass: m_P = √(ħc/G) ≈ 2.2×10⁻⁸ kg
Planck Energy: E_P = m_P c² ≈ 1.96×10⁹ J
```

### Zero-Point Energy

```python
E₀ = (1/2)ħω

For optical frequency (10¹⁴ Hz):
E₀ ≈ 3.3×10⁻²⁰ J
```

### Vacuum Fluctuations

```python
ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2

For femtosecond timescale (10⁻¹⁵ s):
ΔE ≥ 5.3×10⁻²⁰ J
```

### Casimir Effect

```python
F/A = -π²ħc/(240d⁴)

For 1 micrometer separation:
F/A ≈ -1.3×10⁻³ N/m²
```

## Applications

### 1. **Zero-Point Energy**

- Quantum fields have minimum energy even in vacuum

## Connection to Field Spec 0.7

This implementation uses:

- **Zero-Point Energy** (§8.1): `null_cycle → promote → background_curvature`
- **Field Vacuum** (§8): Vacuum = null cycle promotion
- **Field Constants** (§9): Planck constants = field constants
- **Field Energy** (§9): Vacuum energy = field energy

## Key Insight

**Quantum vacuum = field vacuum!**

- Zero-point energy = field zero-point energy (E₀ = (1/2)ħω)
- Vacuum fluctuations = field fluctuations (ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2)
- Planck scales = fundamental field scales (l_P, t_P, m_P, E_P)
- Casimir effect = field boundary effect
- Dark energy = vacuum field energy

All vacuum physics follows field equations!
